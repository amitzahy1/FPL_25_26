
# FPL Ultimate Draft Tool - Instructions V8 (Final)

This document outlines the final logic, features, and design of the FPL Ultimate Draft Tool.

## 1. Core Design & Layout
- **Theme**: The primary color theme is a Pastel Blue gradient (`#a1c4fd` to `#c2e9fb`).
- **Layout**: The tool uses a clean, modern layout with a main header, a legend/key section, filter controls, quick action buttons, and a main player table.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout is designed to be responsive, with filters and controls adapting to different screen sizes.
- **Hover Effects**: Table headers have a hover effect that changes their background color, improving user interaction.

## 2. Key Metrics & Explanations (Legend Bar)
A compact legend bar at the top provides quick explanations for key metrics:
- **ציון דראפט (Draft Score)**: A position-specific score calculated to evaluate a player's value in a draft context. 
    - **GKPs**: Weighted based on Saves (30%), Clean Sheets (25%), BPS (15%), xGC vs Actual GC (15%), PPG (10%), and Bonus (5%).
    - **DEFs**: Weighted based on ICT Index (30%), Clean Sheets (25%), xG+xA (20%), BPS (15%), and Bonus (10%).
    - **MIDs**: Weighted based on ICT Index (35%), xG+xA (30%), BPS (20%), PPG (10%), and Bonus (5%).
    - **FWDs**: Weighted based on xG (40%), ICT Index (25%), BPS (20%), PPG (10%), and Bonus (5%).
- **xDiff**: Represents the difference between expected goal/assist contributions and actual performance (`(xG + xA) - (Goals + Assists)`).
- **ICT**: An FPL index combining Influence, Creativity, and Threat.

## 3. Player Table & Data Display
- **Row Coloring**: Player rows are colored based on their position:
    - **GKP (Goalkeeper)**: Light Yellow (`#fff3cd`)
    - **DEF (Defender)**: Light Blue (`#d1ecf1`)
    - **MID (Midfielder)**: Light Green (`#d4edda`)
    - **FWD (Forward)**: Light Red/Pink (`#f8d7da`)
- **Player Name Icons**: Icons are displayed directly next to the player's name for quick insights.
- **Verbal Insights Column**: A dedicated column provides textual summaries of a player's key attributes (e.g., "בועט פנדלים, דיפרנציאל").
- **Column Order**: The "Draft Score" column is placed immediately after the "Player" column for prominence.
- **Column Width**: The "Player" column width has been reduced for a more compact table view.

## 4. Filtering and Controls
- **Standard Filters**: Users can filter by player name, position, team, price range, minimum total points, minimum selection %, and xDiff range.
- **Quick Filter Bאuttons**: A set of buttons for one-click filtering of common draft strategies.
- **Show Entries**: A dropdown to control the number of players displayed (50, 100, 200, or All).
